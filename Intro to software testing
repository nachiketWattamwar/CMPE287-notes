- Verification
	- Are we building product right?
	- Making sure that software at a specific dev stage is satisfies the requirements established at the beginning of the phase
	
- Validation
	- Are we designing the right product?
	- Set of activities to ensure the software has been build conforming to customer requirements
	
- Objectives of software testing:
	(1) Requirement Confirmation - Confirm the given software product requirements by testing based on the requirements
	(2) Bug Detection – Detect as many bugs as possible through software testing
	(3) Product Assurance quality – Assure the quality of a software product by testing

- Challenges/limitations in software testing:
	(1) Requirements and specifications are not clear
	(2) Engineers lack understanding and knowledge of given product
	(3) Test tools limitations: Many test tools have diverse limitations in technology, programming, and operation platform, and so on.
	(4) Budget and schedule: Lack of resources and time

- Software error/bug: A mismatch between the program and its specification is an error 	

- Software problem management process:
	- Problem detection
	- Problem reporting 
	- Problem assignment
	- Problem analysis
	- Problem resolution
	- Problem validation
	- Problem closure
	
- Testing process:
	1. Test planning: Decide on schedule, test activities, scope, risks, objectives, approach
	2. Test designing: Decide on test cases, test tools, test environment and infra based on soft req specification document
	3. Test execution: perform testing, execute test cases, record test results, test-automation, generate bug reports
	4. Test evaluation: Validate testing results and analyze test coverage, test results, bugs, cost
	
- Software test lifecycle:
	1. Unit testing: blackbox and whitebox testing
	2. Integration testing: component integration
	3. Validation testing: Focus on user scenarios, UI, behaviors
	4. System testing: Performance testing, load testing, stress testing, installation and security testing
